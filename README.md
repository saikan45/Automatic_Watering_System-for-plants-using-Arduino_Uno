# Automatic_Watering_System for plants using Arduino_Uno
 ## Introduction
 ``` 
  In this project, we are talking about an automated system that includes whole watering system.

An automated watering system is such a system that starts watering to plants by measuring soil moisture through soil moisture sensor. In this project we will have some extra benefits. We donâ€™t need to control this watering, because the device will make this automatically when it will need it.
```
### Project Code

```
#include <AFMotor.h>
// DC motor on M2
AF_DCMotor motor(2);
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);          
  motor.setSpeed(1000);
  motor.run(RELEASE);
}
void loop()
{int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(1);       
if(sensorValue>300)
{
motor.run(FORWARD);
}
else
motor.run(RELEASE);
}
```
